Program Description:
The program analyzes student grade data and gives each exams mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.
---
Logical Steps:
1. Load the student grades data from a CSV file into a list, skipping the header.
2. Convert the data into a NumPy array for efficient manipulation.
3. Display the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.
4. Calculate and print the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for each exam.
5. Flatten the data to calculate overall statistics across all exams combined.
6. Count the number of students passing and failing each exam.
7. Calculate the overall pass percentage across all exams by counting the total passing grades and dividing by the total number of grades.

Variables:
data: 2D NumPy array containing the grades for all students across three exams.
exam1, exam2, exam3: Individual grades for each exam (columns in the CSV).
passing_grade: Threshold for passing an exam, set to 60.
all_grades: 1D array created by flattening the data array to consider all grades across exams.
exams_mean, exams_median, exams_std, exams_min, exams_max: Arrays storing statistical measures for each exam.
overall_mean, overall_median, overall_std, overall_min, overall_max: Scalar values for overall statistics across all exams.
passes_per_exam, fails_per_exam: Arrays storing the count of passes and fails for each exam.
total_passes, total_students: Total number of passing grades and total number of grades, used to calculate the overall pass percentage.
overall_pass_percentage: The percentage of students passing across all exams.
