Program Description:
The program simulates population growth in Florida cities and projected population growth
---
Logical Steps:
1. Create database for cities
2. Input the initial data for population
3. Simulate growth with equation in matplotlib
4. Make graph in matplotlib
5. Show user interface to interact with graph and data
---
Variables:
conn: A connection object to the SQLite database.
cursor: A cursor object for executing SQL commands on the database.
florida_cities: A list of tuples containing the city names and their population in 2023.
growth_rate: The annual growth rate for simulating population growth.
years_to_simulate: The number of years to simulate population growth.
cities: A list of cities in Florida to be used in the simulation.
